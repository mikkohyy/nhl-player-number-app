# NHL numbers app
For me, questions related to the jersey numbers that NHl players wear are facinating. For example, why so many goalies wear number that is in the 30s? When this trend started? This app aims to provide tools for looking for trends in the jersey that NHL players use.

From the perspective of learning, this project is meant to be a way of refreshing my skills with TypeScript and React.
